additonal settings added newer options for use with the latest update. with/without user pass makes server password editable on the panel itself for users to access or not instead of server level.


egg-stationeers is depracated. Please use one of the other two. The only different is without-pass does not show some information on the user side of server settings. this prevents allocated users from changing server pass and keeps it within control of the admin. with-pass shows it on the panel.
